# FOCP_FINAL_PROJECT
**Task-1**
The calculate_total_price which calculates the overall cost based on the number of pizzas ordered, whether Tuesdays qualify for a discount, if delivery is required, and whether the order was placed using the app. Using validation loops to make sure valid input, the script asks users for the number of pizzas, if delivery is necessary, whether it's Tuesday, and how often they use the service. The total cost is calculated after deducting a delivery fee for purchases under five pizzas, Tuesday discounts of 50%, and app use discounts of 25%. Next, the entire price that has been calculated is shown.

**Task-2**
The function analyze_cat_shelter, which processes the contents of a file given its name as argument. The code scans every line in the file, looks for information about entry and exit timings, and determines the type of cat ('OURS' or an intruder), before calculating visit durations. It figures out how many times 'our' cat and invaders have visited overall, how long 'our' cat has stayed there overall, and how long, short, and average each visit is. The entire duration is also converted to hours and minutes. The script just needs the filename as its only command-line input, and it handles file-not-found issues. It publishes the calculated statistics if the filename is entered correctly; if not, an error notice is shown.

**Task-3**
Overall, the code we generated in Task offers a simple user management system that allows you to create an account, remove an account, change an account's password, and login to an existing account. File handling, loops, conditions, modules, exception handling, and functions were used to complete the task.In main.py it prompts routines for reading (read_passwd_file) and writing (write_passwd_file) user data, such as usernames, true names, and encrypted passwords. Encrypt_password and decrypt_password use a basic Caesar cipher (shift of 13) to encrypt and decode passwords, respectively. The check_user function validates user credentials by decrypting the stored password and comparing it to the one entered, returning True if the credentials are genuine. This script is required for basic user data management and authentication, however, it employs minimal security approaches that are not appropriate for significant applications.


In adduser.py it prompts The add_user function first reads the existing user data from a file.It asks the user to provide a new password, true name, and username while making sure that none of these areas are left empty. Additionally, it verifies that the username entered already exists in the database. A function from the main module is used to encrypt the password if the username is unique and all fields are filled in. Next, the encrypted password-holding new user is added to the user database. Ultimately, a confirmation message indicating the successful creation of the user is displayed, and the revised database is written back to the file.

In login.py it prompts for user verification and the getpass module for safe password input. The user is prompted for a username and password by the login function; the password input remains anonymous for security reasons. In order to confirm the login and password, it then invokes the main module's check_user method. "Access granted" appears if the credentials are valid. If not, an error notice with the words "Access denied" appears. Invalid password or username." This guarantees user identification before authorizing entry.

In deluser.py it prompts is to remove a user from the system. It begins by utilizing the read_passwd_file method in the main module to read the current user list from a file. After that, the software asks to remove a username. The revised list is written back to the file using the write_passwd_file function from main if the username already exists in the system. If not, it is deleted from the user list. After the user is successfully erased, a confirmation message appears.

In changepass.py it prompts to enable users to modify their passwords. It begins by using main.read_passwd_file() to load the current user info from a file. The user is required to input their current password and username. Using main.check_user(), the username's existence is verified, and the accuracy of the current password is tested. The user is then asked to enter and confirm a new password if the username can be located and the password is accurate. The script checks to make sure the new password matches the confirmation. If they do, main.encrypt_password() is used to encrypt the password, and the user list is updated accordingly. With the help of main.write_passwd_file(), the modified list is written back to the file.The script ends by verifying that the password change was successful. By enabling password updating, this feature improves the user management system's security and usability.
